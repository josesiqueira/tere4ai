# Changelog

All notable changes to TERE4AI v2. Format loosely follows Keep a Changelog;
versions are git tags. Dates are build dates (Europe/Helsinki).

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2026-07-10

First tagged pre-release: the complete evidence-gated pipeline, runtime
tools, evaluation harness, and reference register, built 2026-07-08 to
2026-07-10.

### Graph and pipeline
- Deterministic Layer 1 mirror of the full EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689)
  from frozen, checksummed EUR-Lex HTML and Formex 4 manifestations: 113
  articles, 180 recitals, 13 annexes, plus Definitions (68), Subparagraphs
  (63), verified recital CONTEXT_FOR links, and the Digital Omnibus modelled
  as an amending source (DEC-01, DEC-02, DEC-12).
- Judged Layer 2/3: 434 NormativeStatements (339 judge-accepted) and 620
  reified AlignmentAssertions (475 accepted) with independent-family judges
  (OpenAI generator, Anthropic judge; DEC-03, DEC-05, DEC-06, DEC-07).
- Publication gating (Section 13) plus post-load database gates P1..P5, and
  a build reproducibility chain: every published node and edge carries a
  build_id embedding sha256 checksums of the exact input artifacts.
- Norm near-duplicate hygiene report (rule-based, human-decided).

### Runtime
- All eight Section 8 MCP tools, including deterministic classify_ai_system
  (the LLM never decides risk; DEC-13 feature elicitation splits fact
  extraction from decision), evidence evaluation, control backlog,
  explain_requirement, trace_alignment, coverage_report, source_trace.
- FastAPI HTTP facade with the same envelope (calibrated status vocabulary,
  never "compliant"; DEC-08), agent-discovery endpoints, and a thin
  read-only Next.js demo UI. Mode B docker-compose packaging.

### Evaluation
- M4 harness with the five-condition ablation ladder; two live sweeps on the
  gold seed plus REF-15 benchmark sample. Run 2 headline: graph conditions
  18/32 on free text with 4 honest abstentions and 0.38 citation
  completeness versus plain LLM 24/32 with zero checkable citations.
- FA/FR labeling sheet (50 stratified judge decisions), kappa module,
  elicitation error analysis feeding a classification-ladder fix.

### References
- Authoritative register (SELF/REF/ADD namespaces) with source-type tags,
  DOIs, and status; full-text corpus of 42 papers under data/refs with a
  queryable literature knowledge graph; CI traceability gate over
  @implements / @grounded_by tags.

### Known limitations
- Full-benchmark ablation (339 scenarios + 137 QA) and repeat-run variance
  study are pending (cost-gated); gold-set expansion and FA/FR labeling
  await human annotation; RDF export (DEC-09) is Neo4j-only so far; the
  Omnibus final OJ text is not yet published, so its consolidated provisions
  are not ingested.
